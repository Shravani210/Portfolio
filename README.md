<span> Shravani's Portfolio Website 💼 </span>

This is a fully responsive personal portfolio website created as a self-learning project using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It includes multiple pages that showcase different aspects of my profile — including personal information, skills, education, and more. The **contact form is fully functional**, using **EmailJS** to send emails directly from the site.
